## ðŸš€ Quick Start

1. **Clone this repo and enter the folder:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Stylegunhawk/Artists-Info-through-python-with-Spotify-API.git
   cd Artists-Info-through-python-with-Spotify-API
   ```

2. **Install requirements:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set up your Spotify API credentials:**
   - Go to the [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/).
   - Create an app and get your `Client ID`, `Client Secret`, and set the redirect URI to `http://localhost:8888/callback`.
   - Make a `.env` file in this folder:
     ```env
     SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
     SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
     SPOTIFY_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:8888/callback
     ```

4. **First-time authentication:**
   ```bash
   python spotify_top_artists.py --auth
   # Follow the link, log in, copy the code from the URL
   python spotify_top_artists.py --code YOUR_AUTH_CODE
   ```
   After this, your tokens are saved securely. You only need to do this once!

5. **Explore artists, playlists, and more:**
   ```bash
   python spotify_top_artists.py --menu
   # Or search directly:
   python spotify_top_artists.py --search
   ```

---

## ðŸ¤– How It Works
- After the first login, the script **automatically refreshes your token** when it expires. No need to log in again!
- All your artist info is saved and deduplicated by artist ID.
- You can:
  - Search for artists and view rich details
  - See your playlists
  - Discover popular artists

## ðŸ›  Troubleshooting
- **Token expired or invalid?** The script will refresh it automatically if you did the first login. If you ever get stuck, just repeat the authentication step.
- **.env not found?** Make sure you created it and filled in your Spotify credentials.- **Still stuck?** Open an issue or check your terminal for error messages.
